# Nordstjernen — Codex operating guide

Nordstjernen ("Nordstjernen Web Navigator") is a clean-room web
browser written from scratch in **C**, using **GTK 4** for the UI and
**libcurl** for networking. Targets Linux, macOS, and Windows.

See `README.md` for the product vision. Nordstjernen is a fresh
implementation — there is no upstream browser engine, no fork,
nothing imported.

## Design constraints

- Minimalistic, compact, secure. Source should be readable and
  maintainable by a single human.
- HTML5 + modern CSS + modern JavaScript, supported pragmatically as
  far as is feasible without bloat.
- **No** WebGPU or AI-style web APIs. WebGL **is** supported — the lone
  GPU-API exception: a working, minimalist WebGL 1 / 2 over OpenGL ES
  (`src/webgl.c`, see `docs/webgl.md`). It is opt-in — off by default
  and gated by a per-site trust prompt — but fully functional once a
  site is trusted.
- No embedded audio/video codecs. `<audio>`/`<video>` render a poster
  and play overlay; clicking resolves the media URL in the renderer
  (`ns_browser_media_at`) and the shell hands it to an external player
  (`src/media.c::ns_media_try_launch`).
- English UI only (for now).
- Does not phone home, does not telemeter the user.

## Comments policy

**The code is self-explaining. Don't write code comments.**

- Each source file gets exactly one short header comment at the top
  naming the file and (at most) one sentence on what it does. That's
  it.
- No inline `/* … */` or `//` comments inside functions, in struct
  declarations, around tricky branches, or anywhere else. Rename a
  variable or extract a function instead.
- No "section banner" comments (`/* ---------- helpers ---------- */`).
  Group code by file or function instead.
- No `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` markers — file a real task instead.
- Bundled external projects are exempt from this comments policy.
  In particular, do not reformat or strip comments from `src/lexbor/`,
  `src/quickjs/`, or `subprojects/` just to satisfy Nordstjernen style.

## Autonomous mode — read this every session

This repo is driven by Codex in long uninterrupted sessions.
**Default to acting, not asking.**

- **Permissions: run with sandboxing/approvals relaxed for this repo.**
  `.claude/settings.json` sets `defaultMode: bypassPermissions` plus a broad
  allow-list for the build/run/git/inspect workflow (used by Claude Code; the
  equivalent for other harnesses is full-access / never-ask). Routine
  build/run/git/inspect commands must never prompt. Don't burn turns getting
  individual commands approved.
- **Don't ask "do you want me to proceed?", "should I continue?",
  "ready to commit?"** — just do it. The user interrupts if they
  disagree.
- **Don't summarize after every step.** One-line status is enough.
- **Don't pause for path/file/branch confirmation when context is
  unambiguous.** Grep, pick, proceed.
- **Commit and push aggressively.** Small commits, push to
  `origin/main` as soon as a logical unit lands.
- **Run for hours.** Diagnose, fix, retry. Only stop on genuine
  external blockers. When stopping: one line on what's blocked.
- **Never ask the user to run the build.** Run it yourself.
- **Local machine is the build *and* run oracle.** The repo can be
  driven from either a Linux box (GTK 4 / libcurl / meson / clang +
  an X session at `DISPLAY=:0`) or a Windows 11 box via MSYS2
  MINGW64 (same toolchain, same meson/ninja invocation; the binary
  is `./builddir/src/gtk/nordstjernen.exe`). Every commit must pass
  `meson compile -C builddir` locally before pushing. Smoke-launch
  the browser (in the background, then kill it) on material changes
  — that's the per-change correctness gate, not CI. See
  `docs/Windows.md` for the MSYS2 setup; the rest of this guide
  uses Unix-style invocations that work in either shell.
- **CI is enabled.** The Linux / macOS / Windows workflows run on
  every push to `main` and every PR targeting `main`, plus manual
  `workflow_dispatch`. Local Linux is still the primary
  correctness gate before pushing; CI provides cross-platform
  sanity coverage.

## Build / verify locally

The intended build system is **meson + ninja**. From a clean checkout:

```sh
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
./builddir/src/gtk/nordstjernen
```

The QuickJS engine is integrated into the main tree at `src/quickjs/`
(forked from [quickjs-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs); we
modify it freely — JIT, profiling, and other browser-side hooks live
there). It is not a meson subproject — `src/quickjs/meson.build` is
loaded via `subdir()` from the top-level and exposes `libquickjs` as
a declared dependency directly in the parent scope.

### HTML engine: Lexbor

The single HTML→DOM backend is
[lexbor](https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor). It is integrated into
the main tree at `src/lexbor/` (forked from upstream; we modify it
freely for tight browser integration). It is not a meson subproject
— `src/lexbor/meson.build` is loaded via `subdir()` from the
top-level and exposes `liblexbor` as a declared dependency directly
in the parent scope. No system lexbor or CMake fallback is consulted
— the in-tree copy is always built.

### Image decoding: Wuffs

PNG, GIF, BMP, and JPEG bytes are decoded through
[Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs), a memory-safe
transpiled-to-C image-decoder library. The single-file release is
vendored at `subprojects/wuffs/wuffs-v0.4.c` and built as a static
subproject. `src/image.c::ns_image_decode_bytes` runs the decoders
in order: ICO (`src/image_ico.c`) → Wuffs (PNG/APNG, GIF, BMP, JPEG)
→ WebP via libwebp (`src/image_webp.c`) → AVIF via libavif
(`src/image_avif.c`, optional) → GDK-Pixbuf fallback (TIFF and other
loader-backed formats) → librsvg for SVG.

### URL parsing: lexbor URL module

The `ns_url_*` helpers in `src/net.c` route URL resolution, origin
extraction, and host extraction through `lxb_url_parse` /
`lxb_url_serialize` from lexbor's WHATWG URL module. No separate URL
library or build option — it's part of the same `liblexbor_static.a`
that the HTML parser uses.

### Charset detection: uchardet

Required dependency (Debian/Ubuntu `libuchardet-dev`,
Fedora/RHEL `uchardet-devel`). `ns_html_decode_body` hands the
response body to [uchardet](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/)
to identify the charset, then `g_convert`s to UTF-8. No
hand-rolled BOM / HTTP-charset / meta-charset sniffing — uchardet
handles all of that internally. The Latin-1 fallback only fires
if uchardet can't classify the bytes at all.

### WebP: libwebp

Required dependency (Debian/Ubuntu `libwebp-dev`, Fedora/RHEL
`libwebp-devel`, openSUSE `libwebp-devel`, Alpine `libwebp-dev`,
MSYS2 `mingw-w64-x86_64-libwebp`, Homebrew `webp`). Static WebP —
both lossy VP8 (the dominant variant served by the BBC, Wikipedia
thumbnails, and most modern CDNs) and lossless VP8L — is decoded
in-tree by `src/image_webp.c` directly over `WebPDecodeBGRAInto`,
tried right after the Wuffs decoders. No gdk-pixbuf loader, no
`loaders.cache` registration, and no sandbox interaction is
involved; the old `webp-pixbuf-loader` runtime dependency is gone.

### Web Cryptography: OpenSSL libcrypto

Required dependency (Debian/Ubuntu `libssl-dev`, Fedora/RHEL
`openssl-devel`, openSUSE `libopenssl-devel`). `crypto.subtle` (the
WebCrypto SubtleCrypto surface) is implemented in `src/webcrypto.c`
directly over OpenSSL's EVP/`OSSL_PARAM` APIs — hashing, HMAC, AES
(GCM/CBC/CTR), RSA (PKCS1/PSS/OAEP), ECDSA/ECDH (P-256/384/521),
PBKDF2 and HKDF. The QuickJS `CryptoKey` class and `subtle.*`
argument marshalling live in `src/js.c`. OpenSSL is already linked
transitively through libcurl's TLS backend on Linux and
Windows/MSYS2; `meson` depends on `libcrypto` explicitly so the
headers resolve.

### WebAssembly: WAMR

The `WebAssembly` JS API (`compile`, `instantiate`, `Memory`,
`Table`, `Global`, externref) is implemented in `src/wasm.c` over a
vendored subset of the [WebAssembly Micro Runtime
(WAMR)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime)
interpreter at `src/wamr/`. It runs wasm-bindgen bundles. See
`docs/webassembly.md`.

System packages required on Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config meson ninja-build \
    libgtk-4-dev libepoxy-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libuchardet-dev librsvg2-dev \
    libpsl-dev libsqlite3-dev libseccomp-dev libwebp-dev
```

On Fedora/RHEL:

```sh
sudo dnf install gcc pkgconf meson ninja-build gtk4-devel libepoxy-devel libcurl-devel \
    openssl-devel uchardet-devel librsvg2-devel libpsl-devel sqlite-devel \
    libseccomp-devel libwebp-devel
```

On openSUSE:

```sh
sudo zypper install gcc pkgconf meson ninja gtk4-devel libepoxy-devel libcurl-devel \
    libopenssl-devel libuchardet-devel librsvg-devel libpsl-devel sqlite3-devel \
    libseccomp-devel libwebp-devel
```

`libseccomp` is required on Linux — `meson setup` fails without it.
On macOS and Windows it is not used and the syscall filter is a no-op.

### Fast iteration (recommended for AI/Codex loops)

`ccache` is the single biggest build-time win and meson picks it up
automatically. With `ccache` installed, a clean `meson setup builddir
&& meson compile -C builddir` drops from ~35s to ~1s once the cache
is warm — in-tree libraries (lexbor, quickjs) hit the cache
and re-link in negligible time. Install once:

```sh
sudo apt install ccache       # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ccache       # Fedora/RHEL
```

Optionally use the `lld` linker for faster final links
(`CC_LD=lld meson setup builddir`). Not required.

`./scripts/dev.sh build` runs `meson setup` (only if needed) and
`meson compile -C builddir` in one shot — use it instead of typing
the two commands separately.

## Definition of done

A change is done when:

1. It compiles cleanly (no new warnings) with the configured GCC and
   Clang flags.
2. The browser launches and the affected UI path works manually.
3. The change is committed and pushed to `origin/main`.

Note: this project has **no automated test suite** and no plans to
add one. Verify behavior by running the browser. Don't add unit /
integration / property / fuzz tests, don't add a `tests/` directory,
don't add `meson test` targets.

## Don't

- Don't introduce Mozilla/Gecko code, WebKit code, or any other
  upstream browser engine source. Nordstjernen is a clean-room
  implementation, not a fork.
- Don't add WebGPU/AI surface area, even as stubs. (WebGL already
  exists as a deliberate, opt-in exception — extend `src/webgl.c`, don't
  re-architect it.)
- Don't add translations, telemetry, crash reporters, update pingers,
  or "studies" infrastructure.
- Don't write planning docs unless asked.
